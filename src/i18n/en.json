  "smokep1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Smoke, Andrés Stephanou's fourth solo exhibition with the gallery. Smoke presents a single work. The exhibition marks the reopening of the gallery following the COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdown.",
  "smokep2": "Smoke (2018–20) simulates smoke plumes generated by a custom-built system that incorporates multiple principles which characterize a non-living matter, such as the constant state of change, the impossibility of prediction, exist under a non-replicable sequence of events, the absence of symmetry, among others. Exploring the viewer's sense of randomness, the simulation investigates notions of motion and change.",
  "smokep3": "Through computer science, an algorithm was built, embodying a custom software that generates and manages the smoke imagery exhibited by the simulation. As a starting point for the aesthetic structuring of the smoke imagery, Smoke took as reference video recordings of human-caused wildfires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. The simulation sheds light on global warming issues, investigating the role of art in the climate emergency and intrinsically acting as a catalyst for social change. Smoke exists as a visual manifesto that points to the exponential increase in the last years of human-caused wildfires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, which is resulting in high levels of deforestation and carbon emission, effectively contributing to global warming.",
  "smokep4": "Computer-rendered in real time, having no beginning, middle, and end, Smoke explores the sense of temporality and passage of time. Every simulation frame is a singular composition. Each hour, the simulation generates more than two hundred thousand distinct compositions of the smoke imagery, not exhibiting the same composition twice; the current composition does not recur. Generative, no two visual experiences of Smoke are alike.",
  "sistemasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Collective Motion, Andrés Stephanou's third solo exhibition with the gallery. Collective Motion presents a single work.",
  "sistemasp2": "Collective Motion (2018–19) simulates a set of particles acting in collective motion, existing under a random, unpredictable, and non-replicable sequence of events in quick succession. Thousands of particles in which each particle acts independently but following the same set of behavior rules. Such a set of behavior rules guide each particle on how to respond to the relationship with its nearest neighbors (interaction, alignment, cohesion, and volume). Affected by a never-ending and non-repetitive process of self-organization, the particles dynamically interact with each other. Presenting an endless lifecycle and lifetime, the set of particles continually and slowly mutates and develops itself, incorporating three main changes during its existence: an increase in the ability of the set of particles to utilize resources and energy more effectively and efficiently; an increase in the ability of the set of particles to process and make sense of information; and an increase in the set of particles' knowledge on how to manage the process of self-organization as a result of learning and relearning from history. Exploring the viewer's sense of visual perception, the simulation investigates notions of motion, change, and mutability.",
  "sistemasp3": "Collective Motion takes inspiration from processes of self-organization found in nature and society, in the broadest sense of representation, encompassing from micro to macro scales: complex systems with many constituents exhibiting decentralized behavior. Based on multiple references at once, the artwork is rich in possibilities of meaning and perception, proposing new ways to interpret the world, the everyday, and life itself. Displayed on a big screen, Collective Motion results in a visual experience that invites the viewer to an immersive exercise of contemplation, followed by a free and personal interpretation of the visual language presented in the simulation.", 
  "sistemasp4": "Computer-generated in real time, having no beginning, middle, and end, Collective Motion explores the sense of temporality and passage of time. Every simulation frame is a singular composition. Algorithm-driven, the simulation can generate endless possibilities of compositions. Each hour, Collective Motion generates more than two hundred thousand distinct compositions, generating more than five million in twenty-four hours — not exhibiting the same composition twice. Generative, the artwork sheds light on two principles that rule nature and society: the impossibility of replicating events and the possibility of endless results.",
  "sistemasp5": "Proposing notions of unpredictability, ephemerality, and singularity, the current composition exhibited by the simulation exists for a brief instant of time and after that is discarded, not occurring again; demonstrating the impossibility to predict what composition will emerge and when or even if any composition would emerge at all. Each composition is a result of a singular equation of circumstantial factors, algorithmically calculated and defined, which can't be replicated; each composition is an event that occurs just once time, with a duration of a brief instant of time. No two visual experiences of Collective Motion are alike.",
  "particulasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Growth and Decay, Andrés Stephanou's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Growth and Decay presents a single work.",
  "particulasp2": "Growth and Decay (2017–18) simulates thousands of particles acting in collective behavior, existing under a random, unpredictable, and non-replicable sequence of events in quick succession. Affected by a never-ending and non-repetitive process of self-organization, the particles continually change their state, behaving collectively. Thousands of particles in which each particle acts independently but following the same set of behavior rules. Such a set of behavior rules guide each particle on how to respond to the relationship with its nearest neighbors (interaction, alignment, cohesion, and volume). Growth and Decay investigates notions of randomness and unpredictability, motion and change — the order coming from the chaos. The simulation confronts the dichotomies of life and death, growth and decay, natural and artificial.",
  "particulasp3": "Dealing with notions of space and nothingness, Growth and Decay explores the existential void expressed through the black color. The simulation employs the black color as a visual metaphor of the mind-bending concept of infinity. The blue color scheme presented in the visual language has a direct relation with the color psychology, as the perception of the blue color promotes relaxation and calmness in the human brain, producing tranquilizing qualities that contribute to the immersive and contemplative purpose of the visual experience. As a result, the blue color scheme dialogues with the audience's emotional sense and their resulting psychological state while contemplating the artwork.",
  "particulasp4": "Growth and Decay takes inspiration from processes of self-organization found in nature and society, in the broadest sense of representation, encompassing from micro to macro scales. The simulation is rich in possibilities of meaning and perception, proposing new ways to interpret the world, the everyday, the life itself, and the universe as a whole. At first glance, Growth and Decay exhibits a visual language that connotes something not experienced before, but at the same time, dialogues with the sense-memories of everything each individual had ever looked at. In other words, an strangely familiar visual language, but at the same time, curiously strange.",
  "particulasp5": "No two visual experiences of Growth and Decay are alike. Every simulation frame is a singular composition. Each hour, the simulation generates more than two hundred thousand distinct compositions, generating more than three thousand per minute. Computer-generated in real time, the current composition exhibited by the simulation exists for a brief instant of time and after that is discarded, not occurring again. Growth and Decay sheds light on two principles that rule nature and society phenomena: the impossibility of replicating events and the possibility of endless results.",
  "microp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Chaos, Andrés Stephanou's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Chaos presents a single work.",
  "microp2": "Chaos (2016–17) simulates particles within space existing under an unpredictable and chaotic sequence of events that continually influence the interaction between the particles. Affected by a never-ending and non-repetitive process of self-organization, the particles interact with each other attracting or repelling. Such simulated forces are generated by the unpredictable and chaotic sequence of events, incorporating a system in which acquires emergent properties that cannot be directly predicted from the individual properties of each particle. Exploring the viewer's sense of visual perception, Chaos investigates notions of motion and change — the order coming from the chaos.",
  "microp3": "Monochromatic, Chaos evokes a binary microscopic vision: the light grey background and the dark grey particles recall the light-field and dark-field aesthetic characteristics of microscopy. Visually, the artwork is fundamentally about minimalism as it is reduced to its most basic components (color and form).",
  "microp4": "Chaos takes inspiration from processes of self-organization found in nature and society, in the broadest sense of representation, encompassing from micro to macro scales. The simulation is rich in possibilities of meaning and perception, proposing new ways to interpret the world, the everyday, and life itself. Displayed on a big screen, Chaos results in a visual experience that invites the viewer to an immersive exercise of contemplation, followed by a free and personal interpretation of the visual language presented in the simulation.",
  "microp5": "Every simulation frame is a singular composition. Each composition is a phenomenon that occurs just once time, with a duration of a brief instant of time. Algorithm-driven, Chaos does not exhibit the same composition twice. The current composition exhibited by the simulation exists for a brief instant of time and after that is discarded, not occurring again; demonstrating the impossibility to predict what composition will emerge and when or even if any composition would emerge at all. Computer-generated in real time, having no beginning, middle, and end, Chaos explores the sense of temporality and passage of time, dealing with notions of unpredictability, ephemerality, and singularity.",
  "contatop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Contato Visual, Chiaki Mihara's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Two digital animations and a drawing are presented.",
  "contatop2": "The digital animations Contato Visual (Azul) (2019) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) (2019) present two pairs of animated eyes moving under their own emotional condition, constantly changing the expression. Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) are presented projected on the gallery's walls. Introducing to the audience an exercise of symbiotic empathy, the digital animations communicate with the natural reaction of confrontation generated by the human brain when an eye-to-eye contact is processed — on this occasion, the visual contact between the viewer and the animated eyes. The viewer is invited to confront Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) and interpret the emotional state exhibited in the artworks.",
  "contatop3": "With simple lines, the large and brightly colored eyes are an influence of the Japanese descent of Chiaki Mihara and her relationship with anime. Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) intrinsically introduce a dialogue around identity and cultural issues.",
  "contatop4": "Estudo para Contato Visual (2019) presents one of the drawings produced by Chiaki Mihara as a study for the construction of the digital animations Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho). The drawing proposes an understanding of the process of conception of the digital animations presented.",
  "autoretratosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A series of six drawings produced with oil pastel is presented. Through a meticulous technique, her work investigates the intersection of classical and modern practices of the art-history. Chiaki Mihara's unique imagery language pays tribute to a vast array of art-historical traditions and genres, gathering together elements of Renaissance portraiture with allusions to contemporary Japanese culture.",
  "autoretratosp2": "Autorretratos exemplifies Chiaki Mihara’s drawing aesthetics. The series investigates the influence of anime and the artist's Japanese descent on her practice, intrinsically introducing cultural and identity issues.",
  "atividadep1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present A pesca enquanto atividade humana, Emerson da Silva's third solo exhibition with the gallery. A triptych film, an installation of photographs, and a photograph are presented.",
  "atividadep2": "The triptych film Entre o Céu e o Oceano (2019) documented a fisherman's day of activity on a fishing platform located in a coastal region of the Atlantic Ocean, in southern Brazil. The triptych film recorded the complex equation for good fishing, which is structured on the interrelationship of knowledge about local climatic, biological, and cultural factors. Entre o Céu e o Oceano investigates the historical, cultural, and social relationships between the human being and the ocean. “The culture of a local, as a heritage of its population, is carved as a way of life of a social group according to the idealized vision of being and seeing the world in which they are inserted. Such a way of life is defined from subjective and objective practices, introducing forms of social particularities,” Emerson da Silva said.",
  "atividadep3": "Espécies de Peixes do Litoral Sul Brasileiro (2019) presents an installation of sixteen photographs. The installation was conceived as a catalog of fish species typical of the region documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano. During a month, in a close relationship with local fishermen, Emerson da Silva followed the activity on the fishing platform portrayed in the film, photographing and documenting the fishes caught by the fishermen.",
  "atividadep4": "In Papa-Terra (2019), a photograph is presented. The photograph portrays a local fisherman from the fishing platform documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano during the process of cleaning a fish for consumption. As a visual metaphor, Papa Terra introduces a representation of fishing while a historical identity of a way of life.",
  "ventosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Regime dos Ventos, Emerson da Silva's second solo exhibition with the gallery. A film, an installation of photographs, and a photograph are presented.",
  "ventosp2": "The film Regime dos Ventos (2018) documented the wind as the key element in the landscape formation of a coastal region in southern Brazil. The film investigates the climatic factors of a coastal region and the relationship established between the human being and nature. Regime dos Ventos is structured in three pillars: coastal dunes formed by the wind, the burial of buildings in areas of action of the natural course of the wind, and the adaptation of the human being through the construction of a wind farm.",
  "ventosp3": "Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento (2018) introduces three individual photographs installed as a triptych. Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento incorporates the visual narrative presented in Regime dos Ventos from three photographs that portray the three pillars of the film.",
  "ventosp4": "A photograph titled Parque Eólico (2018) presents the wind farm documented in the film Regime dos Ventos when portrayed at night.",
  "terrap1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Luz, Água e Terra Preta, Emerson da Silva's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A film, an installation of photographs, and a photograph are presented. Luz, Água e Terra Preta marks the first exhibition presented at Galeria Palácio.",
  "terrap2": "The film Terrestre (2017) documented the life cycle of a group of lettuce in a small garden, from fertilization to pre-harvest. The development of the lettuce garden was recorded through the construction of a conjuncture formed by notions of social and cultural order (the personal relationship of each human being with the environment in which he inhabits), of spatial order (the construction of a narrative within a portion of space), and of systematic order (the relationship between the human being and nature). Terrestre is incorporated through four events: the lettuce seeds fertilization in modules; the transplantation of seedlings seeded, at the beginning of life, to the terrestrial soil; the beauty of the lettuce development cycle; and the reach of adulthood of the group of lettuce grown.",
  "terrap3": "In Alface Lisa (2017), a photograph portrays one of the lettuces of the small garden documented in the film Terrestre. The photograph recorded the lettuce at the time of the growth cycle that precedes the pre-harvest.",
  "terrap4": "Through an installation of seven photographs, Luz, Água e Terra Preta (2017) introduces a visual narrative analogous to the film Terrestre. The key elements employed in the construction of the film directly dialogue and relate through photographs arranged together.",
  "lugarp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. A virtual reality artwork, a 3D printed sculpture, and a diptych of digital prints are presented.",
  "lugarp2": "Um lugar para estar (2018–19) simulates a virtual natural environment presented in virtual reality, which is visualized in a first-person perspective. The three-dimensional environment may be visualized on daytime and nighttime incidences of simulated light. “When comparing: the experience of being in a physical natural environment and the experience of being in a virtual natural environment, which replicates a physical natural environment and is visualized through virtual reality. Is it possible for similar emotional results to be obtained?” Lucas Alves Costa said.",
  "lugarp3": "Being outdoors, seeing vegetation and the sky, feeling in touch with nature, are associated with high levels of emotional well-being. A close result is expected in a virtual reality experience that simulates a natural environment. Detail-rich, Um lugar para estar invites the viewer to interpret the ability of a virtual natural environment to play the same emotional role of a physical natural environment. In the end, the artwork virtually deconstructs the need for physical dimensions to be in a natural environment.",
  "lugarp4": "In Superfície de Um lugar para estar (2019), a sculpture embodied through 3D printing is presented on a plinth. The portion of space used for the construction of the virtual natural environment introduced in Um lugar para estar was materialized into a sculpture. From a small scale, the sculpture proposes the notion of the spatial dimension of the virtual natural environment of Um lugar para estar. The artwork exemplifies Lucas Alves Costa's research around notions of space and spatiality. Superfície de Um lugar para estar investigates the possibility of digitally modeling a topography with unique characteristics, not based on real data. The sculpture marks the presentation of a new body of work produced by Lucas Alves Costa, which consists of 3D printed sculptures.",
  "lugarp5": "Incidência de luz de Um lugar para estar (2019) presents a diptych of two digital prints. The digital prints introduce the same portrait screenshotted in the virtual natural environment of Um lugar para estar, differentiated by the incidence of simulated light on the virtual environment: daytime and nighttime.",
  "tropicalp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Paraíso, the first solo exhibition by Lucas Alves Costa with the gallery. A film and a painting are presented.",
  "tropicalp2": "The film Paraíso (2017) documented the artist Chiaki Mihara producing a painting amid the Atlantic Forest, in southern Brazil. Recorded in the film, Chiaki Mihara originated a watercolor painting that portrays the environment chosen as a subject, embodying a pictorial composition. Paraíso investigates the human presence in an environment of abundant nature and his resulting personal spatial perception. Documenting a place with rich fauna and flora, the film implicitly introduces Lucas Alves Costa's personal point of view of an environment that may visually represent Brazil in its essence. “Incorporate the intrinsic network of relationships established between the human being and space, exploring the role of each variable present in the environment and broadening the notion of complexity of this network,” Lucas Alves Costa said about the film.",
  "tropicalp3": "Produced by Chiaki Mihara during the film Paraíso, the painting Mata Atlântica (2017) is presented. Chiaki Mihara interpreted the watercolor painting as a portrait visually expressive to the variations of nature, far from the static, linear, and unchanging concept of space (running water, light changing, and movement of vegetation).",
  "mundoAbertop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Mundo Aberto, Lucas Alves Costa's second solo exhibition with the gallery. A virtual reality artwork and a digital print are presented. Lucas Alves Costa's practice explores notions of space and spatiality. “Understanding the influence of spatial circumstances on social relationships enables the characterization of subjacent factors that directly contribute to the personal construction of each individual,” Lucas Alves Costa said.",
  "mundoAbertop2": "Mundo Aberto (2017–18) simulates an open-world environment with an extensive area, presented in virtual reality. Through free autonomy from a first-person perspective, Mundo Aberto explores the viewer's notion of the spontaneity of action in a three-dimensional virtual environment. “The human brain's response to the perception of an environment is primarily processed from the light, color, and texture present in an environment,” Lucas Alves Costa said, taking as a starting point for the construction of Mundo Aberto. The artwork investigates the complex beauty of topography, dialoguing with the viewer's perception of spatial composition.",
  "mundoAbertop3": "In Perspectiva aérea de Mundo Aberto (2018), a digital print is presented. The artwork introduces an aerial perspective of Mundo Aberto virtual environment in which can't be visualized by the viewer in the virtual reality experience's first-person perspective.",
  "estadio1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Estádio, Emerson da Silva's fourth solo exhibition with the gallery. Estádio is an online-only exhibition presented exclusively at the gallery's Online Viewing Room. A film and two installations of photographs are presented.",
  "estadio2": "The film Estádio (2020) documented a football stadium which is a cultural, historical, social, and political symbol of Cidreira, a city on the southern coast of Brazil — recorded from an aerial perspective through an unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). Built-in the middle of an area of wind dune formation, the stadium is in disuse and a state of neglect, planned to be imploded due to its advanced process of deterioration. In the near future, the film will naturally become a historical record. Estádio investigates the relationships of intervention and exploration of the human being over the natural landscape, proposing perception of the spatial composition resulting from such relationships.",
  "estadio3": "In Estádio (Aerofotografias) (2020), an installation of photographs is presented. Introducing the football stadium portrayed in the film Estádio, the installation is composed of multiple aerial photographs of the building, expanding the notion of spatial and social context in which the stadium is inserted.",
  "estadio4": "Estádio (Fotografias) (2020) presents three photographs installed as a triptych. Distinct from the aerial perspective that documented the football stadium in the film Estádio, Estádio (Fotografias) portrays the building when visualized from the ground, from a first-person perspective. The three photographs introduce the stadium recorded in three distinct angles, days, and times of the day.",
  "selectedWorks1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Selected Works, an online-only group exhibition that inaugurates the gallery's Online Viewing Room. For Selected Works, four works previously presented at the gallery's physical space in solo exhibitions of Andrés Stephanou, Chiaki Mihara, Emerson da Silva, and Lucas Alves Costa, were selected for the exhibition. Superfície de Um lugar para estar (2019), of Lucas Alves Costa; Terrestre (2017), of Emerson da Silva; Growth and Decay (2017–18), of Andrés Stephanou; and Autorretrato (2) (2018), of Chiaki Mihara, are presented.",
  "selectedWorks2": "The sculpture Superfície de Um lugar para estar was presented in Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. The sculpture embodied through 3D printing materializes the portion of space used for the construction of the virtual natural environment of Um lugar para estar (2018–19), an virtual reality experience.

Affected by a never-ending and non-repetitive process of self-organization, the particles continually change their state, behaving collectively. Growth and Decay takes inspiration from the processes of self-organization found in nature and society, in the broadest sense of representation, encompassing from micro to macro scales. The simulation confronts the dichotomies of life and death, growth and decay, natural and artificial.",
  "selectedWorks5": "Part of a series of seven self-portraits drawings, Autorretrato (2) was presented in Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Produced with oil pastel on linen, Autorretrato (2) exemplifies Chiaki Mihara’s drawing aesthetics. The artwork investigates the influence of anime and the artist's Japanese descent on her practice, intrinsically introducing cultural and identity issues.",

  "andresA1": "Through simulations, Andrés Stephanou's work explores the fields of nature and society, employing algorithms as raw-matter and computer science as a method. His practice investigates the role of art in the digital age and the intersections of art and technology, connecting to multiple art historical and contemporary references.",
  "andresA2": "Every simulation's frame is the result of an unpredictable, and non-repetitive equation of circumstantial factors, algorithmically calculated and defined. The current resulting frame exists for a brief instant of time and after that is discarded, not occurring twice. Computer-generated in real time, having no beginning, middle, and end, the simulations dialogue with the viewer's sense of temporality and passage of time, dealing with notions of unpredictability, ephemerality, and singularity.",
  "andresA3": "Displayed on big screens, the simulations result in visual experiences that invite the audience to an immersive exercise of contemplation. “I'm interested in the fact that the work is constantly shifting, happening in the instant of time. Never being the same; never repeating itself. Nothing can be predicted. You see the work exhibiting a composition, and then it instantly and unpredictably changes, directly dealing with the notion of ephemerality,” Andrés Stephanou said. His research points to notions of motion, change, and mutability, communicating with the viewer's sense of visual perception.",
  "chiakiA1": "Chiaki Mihara's practice encompasses drawings, paintings, and digital animations. Having drawing as a foundation, her work explores the perception and notion of gesture and emotion. Due to her Japanese descent, Chiaki Mihara has the culture of Japan, especially the anime, as a direct influence on her practice. In her drawings, paintings, and digital animations, Chiaki Mihara intrinsically introduces cultural and identity issues.",
  "chiakiA2": "Through a meticulous technique, her work investigates the intersection of classical and modern practices of the art-history. Chiaki Mihara's unique imagery language pays tribute to a vast array of art-historical traditions and genres, gathering together elements of Renaissance portraiture with allusions to contemporary Japanese culture.",
  "emersonA1": "Emerson da Silva works with photography and film, investigating the relationship between human beings and nature. In his practice, Emerson da Silva encompasses social, cultural, and spatial questions, portraying processes of exploration, extraction, and intervention of the human being over the natural environment. Throughout his beginning in photography, Emerson da Silva drew on the narrative qualities of his photographs to begin the transition from still images to working also with films.",
  "emersonA2": "Having as a central pillar of his practice, Emerson da Silva explores the concept that protographs record moments which are a historical, social, and cultural statement of a specific time and place. Emerson da Silva documents his photographs and films from the construction of contexts formed by elements of social and cultural order (the personal relationship of each human being with the environment which he inhabits); of spatial order (the construction of a narrative around a place and its particular spatial composition); and of systemic order (the network of processes established in relationships between the human being and nature). “The culture of a local, as a heritage of its population, is carved as a way of life of a social group according to the idealized vision of being and seeing the world in which they are inserted. Such a way of life is defined from subjective and objective practices, introducing forms of social particularities,” Emerson da Silva said.",
  "emersonA3": "Exploring the coastal region of southern Brazil as the main subject of his photographs and films, Emerson da Silva detaches from the formal showcasing of Brazil's and its nature, usually connected to the Amazon or Atlantic forest.",
  "lucasA1": "Lucas Alves Costa's interdisciplinary practice ranges from virtual reality artworks and 3D printed sculptures to films. Taking as a central subject of his research, Lucas Alves Costa investigates notions of space and spatiality. In his work, Lucas Alves Costa sheds light on the effects of environmental conditions on individual emotions as well as how each individual perceives and interprets it. “Understanding the influence of spatial circumstances on social relationships enables the characterization of subjacent factors that directly contribute to the personal construction of each individual,” Lucas Alves Costa said.",
  "lucasA2": "Having as reference principles of video game design and psychology, Lucas Alves Costa's virtual reality artworks invites the audience to interpret the ability of virtual environments to play the same emotional role as physical environments. Proposing to the viewer a free autonomy spatial exploration from a first-person perspective, the virtual reality artworks propose perception of the spontaneity of action in an environment of virtual dimensions — and how the viewer's emotional sense reacts to it.",
  "lucasA3": "In his films, Lucas Alves Costa incorporates the network of relationships established between the human being and space, exploring punctual places as the central subject. Recorded in 4K, the films investigate the role of each variable present in spatial compositions, expanding the notion of complexity of the network of relationships established between the human being and space.",
  "terrenoVR": "The sculpture Superfície de Um lugar para estar was presented in Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. The sculpture embodied through 3D printing materializes the portion of space used for the construction of the virtual natural environment of Um lugar para estar (2018–19), an virtual reality experience. From a small scale, the sculpture proposes the notion of the spatial dimension of the virtual natural environment of Um lugar para estar. The artwork exemplifies Lucas Alves Costa's research around notions of space and spatiality.  Superfície de Um lugar para estar marks the presentation of a new body of work produced by Lucas Alves Costa, which consists of 3D printed sculptures.",
  "terrestreVR": "The film Terrestre was presented in Luz, Água e Terra Preta, Emerson da Silva's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Terrestre documented the life cycle of a group of lettuce in a small garden, from fertilization to pre-harvest. The development of the lettuce garden was recorded through the construction of a conjuncture formed by elements of social, cultural, spatial, and systematic order. Terrestre investigates the relationship between the human being and nature — the human being and his relationship of intervention and exploration of the environment in which he habits.",
  "lightVR": "The simulation Growth and Decay was presented in Growth and Decay, Andrés Stephanou's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Computer-generated in real time, Growth and Decay simulates thousands of particles acting in collective behavior, existing under a random, unpredictable, and non-replicable sequence of events in quick succession. Affected by a never-ending and non-repetitive process of self-organization, the particles continually change their state, behaving collectively. Growth and Decay takes inspiration from the processes of self-organization found in nature and society, in the broadest sense of representation, encompassing from micro to macro scales. The simulation confronts the dichotomies of life and death, growth and decay, natural and artificial.",
  "autorretratoVR": "Part of a series of seven self-portraits drawings, Autorretrato (2) was presented in Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Produced with oil pastel on linen, Autorretrato (2) exemplifies Chiaki Mihara’s drawing aesthetics. The artwork investigates the influence of anime and the artist's Japanese descent on her practice, intrinsically introducing cultural and identity issues.",
  "estadioVR": "The film Estádio (2020) documented a football stadium which is a cultural, historical, social, and political symbol of Cidreira, a city on the southern coast of Brazil — recorded from an aerial perspective through an unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). Built-in the middle of an area of wind dune formation, the stadium is in disuse and a state of neglect, planned to be imploded due to its advanced process of deterioration. In the near future, the film will naturally become a historical record. Estádio investigates the relationships of intervention and exploration of the human being over the natural landscape, proposing perception of the spatial composition resulting from such relationships.",
  "estadioAerofotografiasVR": "In Estádio (Aerofotografias) (2020), an installation of photographs is presented. Introducing the football stadium portrayed in the film Estádio, the installation is composed of multiple aerial photographs of the building, expanding the notion of spatial and social context in which the stadium is inserted.",
  "estadioFotografiasVR": "Estádio (Fotografias) (2020) presents three photographs installed as a triptych. Distinct from the aerial perspective that documented the football stadium in the film Estádio, Estádio (Fotografias) portrays the building when visualized from the ground, from a first-person perspective. The three photographs introduce the stadium recorded in three distinct angles, days, and times of the day.",
