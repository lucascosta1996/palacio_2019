  "sistemasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Sistemas e Processos, Andrés Stephanou's third solo exhibition with the gallery. Two works are presented, originated from two new custom software conceived by the artist.",
  "sistemasp2": "In Organismo Digital (2018–2019), a concentrated mass of orchestrated particles performs in continuous motion in space, under unscheduled activity, in constant rearrangement. Composed in real-time, Organismo Digital is a simulation generated by a custom software conceived by the artist, managed by random algorithms, in an operation realized by a computer. At every instant of time, an unreplicable visual composition is created by the custom software. The visual composition generated by the software in the present will not recur in the future. Organismo Digital synthesizes Andrés Stephanou's central production research: replicate the constant alterability, the infinite variability and unpredictability of nature, in its broader field of subjectivity.",
  "sistemasp3": "In contrast to the complexity of construction present in Organismo Digital, a line of light generated by a new custom software conceived by Andrés Stephanou is presented on one of the gallery's walls, impalpable to the public. Built with algorithms, 1 minuto (2019)  executes a complete process of sixty seconds, continuously, in rotary motion proposing to the viewer an experience of notion and perception to the equivalence and velocity of the passage of time.",
  "sistemasp4": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "particulasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Partículas de Luz, Andrés Stephanou's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Representational subjectivity, linked to the temporal, spatial, and material notion, are key guidelines in the artist's production. Andrés Stephanou's research is based on the concept of infinite reconfiguration, exploring the non-repetition capacity of an artwork through the creation of generative digital systems. His works replicate the compositional alterability and variability present in processes and patterns of nature.",
  "particulasp2": "Partículas de Luz presents two works built from a new custom software conceived by the artist, introduced to the public in two visualization versions of the generated visual matter by the software. Partículas de Luz 1 (2017–2018) and Partículas de Luz 2 (2017–2018) are presented in real-time, operated by individual custom computers in unconnected processes. With infinite duration and never repetitive visual configuration, the works reorganize in constant and random flux, producing unprogrammed and aleatory visual states, self-defined by algorithms.",
  "particulasp3": "In Partículas de Luz, a unique exhibition is created at each instant of time. During the one-hour exhibition period, more than two hundred thousand distinct versions of Partículas de Luz 1 and Partículas de Luz 2 are self-generated, never occurring again each version. If arranged operating uninterruptedly for 24 hours, each of the works can generate over five million distinct visual compositions. The visual composition generated by the custom software in the present instant does not recur again in the future.",
  "particulasp4": "Partículas de Luz 1 and Partículas de Luz 2 have no beginning, middle, and end; are composed in real-time. In a proposal to the understanding of temporality — past, present, and future —, the presented works introduce to the viewer a feeling of continuous expectation, due to the unpredictability of the next visual instant to be generated by the custom software and the contemplation of the ephemeral present instant, that will not return to occur in the future.",
  "particulasp5": "Not presented by Andrés Stephanou in the exhibition, there are two works that introduce to other visualization versions of the visual matter generated by the custom software. In Partículas de Luz 3 (2017–2018) a high zoom view of the visual matter generated by the software is introduced, while in Partículas de Luz (VR) (2017–2018) the visualization of the visual matter generated by the software is presented in virtual reality for free exploration to the viewer, in an immersive experience.",
  "particulasp6": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "microp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Micropartículas, Andrés Stephanou's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Micropartículas is dedicated to the presentation of a single work with a homonymous title to the exhibition.",
  "microp2": "In Micropartículas (2016–2017), thousands of particles interact and reorganize in a space, presenting aleatory visual estates. Under gravitational influence defined by random algorithms, the work produces a new irreplicable visual composition at each instant of time, being never repetitive. Micropartículas is a work composed in real-time by a custom software conceived by the artist and operated by a custom high performance computer. In an infinite activity, with ephemeral, cyclical and self-configuring moments, Micropartículas never repeat the visual composition generated at each instant of time.",
  "microp3": "Micropartículas translates and synthesizes, in concise language, the concept of infinite reconfiguration explored by Andrés Stephanou. The creation of self-managing works with self-sustaining and self-executing processes, that can produce visual uniqueness at every moment, nonrepetitive. The central pillar of the concept developed by the artist is the possibility of introducing own life to the works, replicating the alterability and variability of processes and patterns seen in nature, in a subjective visual context. Unpredictable, uncontrollable, unreplicable and interminable processes that generate visual matter in real-time.",
  "microp4": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "contatop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Contato Visual, Chiaki Mihara's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Disposed in individual gallery rooms, two digital animations and one drawing are presented.",
  "contatop2": "In the works Contato Visual (1) (2018–2019) and Contato Visual (2) (2019), Chiaki Mihara digitally developed two pairs of animated eyes, introduced projected into the exhibition space, in a direct confrontation with the public. With an incorporeal presence in the exhibition, the animated eyes move vividly under their own emotional condition. Presenting constant changes of expression, the public is induced to confront them, face to face, in an attempt to understand the present emotional state in the works. With striking lines, the large, round, and brightly colored eyes are a direct influence of the anime culture and the Japanese descent of Chiaki Mihara.",
  "contatop3": "An empathic exercise  of emotional reading on the other is built between the works and the viewer. In Contato Visual, the subject other are the works, resulting in a proposal of socialization between the public and the works presented",
  "contatop4": "One of the drawings made by Chiaki Mihara as a study for the conception of the digital animations Contato Visual (1) and Contato Visual (2), is presented framed in a gallery room. In Estudo para Contato Visual (2018), several eyes, of multiple formats, under various emotional states, are figured proposing to the public an understanding of the conception and construction of the exhibition.",
  "contatop5": "Chiaki Mihara (1997, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "autoretratosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Having as its artistic foundation the drawing and influenced by anime culture due to its Japanese descent, in Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara proposes to the public a personal and introspective confrontation with questions that refer to cultural and identity origins. In Autorretratos, an intimate sense is established to Chiaki Mihara's drawing aesthetics, introducing to the public an understanding and synthesis of the artist's foundations of production.",
  "autoretratosp2": "A series of six concise and monochrome drawings are presented, produced with oil pastel crayons on linen. The drawings introduce Chiaki Mihara's self-portraits, proposing to the public an intimate figuration of familiarities that guide the artist.",
  "autoretratosp3": "Chiaki Mihara (1997, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "atividadep1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present A pesca enquanto atividade humana, Emerson da Silva's third solo exhibition with the gallery. The artist continues to investigate, through objective and subjective topics, the relational particularities between human beings and nature. The human being and his socio-cultural relationship with the space in which he lives.",
  "atividadep2": "In the triptych film Entre o Céu e o Oceano (2019, three-channel HD video, 5.1 sound, 10 min), is proposed a dialogue of cultural relations between the human and the ocean. The human and his activity of exploration and extraction of nature present in the space in which he inhabits. A day of activity on a maritime platform, located in a coastal region of the Atlantic Ocean in southern Brazil, is documented by Emerson da Silva. From the preparation of fishing gear to the catching and cleaning the fish for consumption. Under an imagery language, Emerson da Silva documents the complex equation for good fishing, structured in an interrelation of knowledge about the site-specific climatic and cultural factors.",
  "atividadep3": "Sixteen photos of fish compose Espécies do Litoral Sul Brasileiro (2018-2019), an installation introduced as a catalog of species typical of the region documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano. Papa Terra, Sardinha, Baiacu Arara, Bagre, Maria Luiza, Xaréu, Peixe Espada, Savelha, Biterra, Peixe Rei, Linguado, Corvina, Branquinho, Pampo, Tainha e Bocuda — species of fish that inhabit the south coast of Brazil — are arranged composing the installation Espécies do Litoral Sul Brasileiro. During a month, in a contiguity relationship with local fishermen, Emerson da Silva followed the fishing activity on the sea platform recorded in the film, photographing and cataloging the fish caught by the fishermen.",
  "atividadep4": "In Pré-Consumo, Papa Terra (2019) and Pré-Consumo, Arraia (2019), two photographs are presented, portraying local fishermen during the process of cleaning a fish and a stingray for consumption. Subjectively, the photographs propose a symbolic reflection on fishing as a source of food and historical identity of way of life.",
  "atividadep5": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "ventosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present O Regime dos Ventos, Emerson da Silva's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Installed in individual rooms in the gallery, a film with a homonymous title of the exhibition, a composition of three photographs, and a photograph are presented..",
  "ventosp2": "In the film O Regime dos Ventos (2018, HD video, stereo, 14 min), Emerson da Silva documented wind as an agent in landscape formation in a coastal region in southern Brazil. On one side, the Atlantic Ocean. On the other side, coastal dunes. Amid this scenario, the buildings of the region's inhabitants are constantly buried, little by little, due to the sand carried by continuous wind actions. In an adaptation to the local weather conditions, a wind farm was built in the region. In O Regime dos Ventos (2018), three directly interconnected spheres are documented: (1) coastal sand dunes formed by wind; (2) burial of buildings in areas of action of the natural course of the wind; (3) the adaptation of the human being to the climatic conditions of the space in which he lives through the construction of a wind farm.",
  "ventosp3": "Directly related to the film O Regime dos Ventos, three photographs are presented in a triptych composition. In Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento (2018), the photographs introduce a static condensation of the imagery and documentary dialogue proposed in the film O Regime dos Ventos.",
  "ventosp4": "In Parque Eólico Litorâneo (2018), a nighttime photograph of the wind farm documented in the film O Regime dos Ventos is presented.",
  "ventosp5": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "terrap1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Luz, Água and Terra Preta, Emerson da Silva's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A film, a photo installation, and an individual photograph are presented, interconnected by the same conceptual bond.",
  "terrap2": "In Terrestre (2017, HD video, stereo, 12 min), the life cycle of a group of lettuce in a small garden is documented for two months. The lettuce and its evolutionary process are figured as a resonance of life on the planet Earth. Fertile to life, the earth's surface as a cultivation ground for food production; the planet Earth and its unique weather conditions. The film is structured in four conjunctures:",
  "terrap3": [
    "- The seed fertilization in modules.",
    "- The transplantation of seedlings seeded, at the beginning of life, to the terrestrial soil.",
    "- The changing plasticity during the lettuce development life cycle.",
    "- The reach of adulthood of the group of lettuce grown and its final harvest."
  ],
  "terrap4": "In Pré-Consumo, Alface Lisa (2017), a photograph introduced as a symbolic image to the dialogue introduced in the film Terrestre is presented. The photograph perpetuates the existence of a lettuce from the small garden documented in the film, at the time of the pre-harvest life cycle; and subsequent consumption.",
  "terrap5": "An imagery narrative parallel to the one introduced in the film Terrestre is presented in an installation of seven photographs, with a homonymous title of the exhibition. In Luz, Água e Terra Preta (2017), the key elements employed by Emerson da Silva in the construction of the film Terrestre dialogue and interrelate directly and indirectly. To the public is proposed an understanding of the narrative presented in Terrestre from a new imagery composition.",
  "terrap6": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "lugarp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. The viewer is invited to participate in a new immersive experience in virtual reality built by the artist, with homonymous title to the exhibition.",
  "lugarp2": "From the digital creation of a virtual environment, introduced in virtual reality, Lucas Alves Costa deconstructs the need for physical dimensions to be in a natural environment. In Um lugar para estar (VR, 2018–2019), is introduced to the viewer the notion of being present at a natural environment from an experience in virtual reality. Um lugar para estar is presented in two POV viewing versions, for the free choice during the experience: daytime and nighttime. The virtual reality experience is simultaneously transmitted to the rest of the public present at the exhibition.",
  "lugarp3": "When compared the experience of being in a natural environment and the experience of being in a virtual environment, which replicates a natural environment, visualized through virtual reality. Is it possible for similar emotional results to be obtained?",
  "lugarp4": "Being outdoors, seeing vegetation and the sky, feeling in touch with nature, are associated with high levels of emotional well-being. A close result is expected in an experience introduced in virtual reality, which visually replicates a natural environment. The viewer is proposed to perform an insight exercise on the capacity of a virtual environment to play the same emotional role as a natural environment. The relationship between human being and the physical environment in which he finds himself as a direct influence to define his emotional state.",
  "lugarp5": "In Terreno (2019), a 3D print is presented on a plinth. The portion of geographic space utilized for the construction of the virtual environment introduced in Um lugar para estar is physically materialized in a miniature. From a small scale, is proposed a perception and notion to the spatial dimension of the virtual environment.",
  "lugarp6": "In another room of the gallery, two images printed on Foam plates are presented. In A incidência de luz em um ambiente virtual (2019), two screenshots taken by Lucas Alves Costa in the virtual environment of Um lugar para estar are presented, introducing the two visualization versions proposed in the virtual experience: daytime and nighttime.",
  "lugarp7": "Lucas Alves Costa (1996, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "tropicalp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Paraíso Tropical, the first solo exhibition by Lucas Alves Costa with the gallery. A film with a homonymous title to the exhibition and two works directly related to the film are presented.",
  "tropicalp2": "In the film Paraíso Tropical (2017, 4K, stereo, 14 min), Lucas Alves Costa documented the artist Chiaki Mihara producing a painting in an outdoors moment of complete personal introspection. In a magical setting of abundant flora and fauna, Chiaki Mihara originated a rereading of the environment's atmosphere in a watercolor painting. In the middle of an Atlantic forest vegetation, there’s a passage of freshwater; the artist collected the same water to dissolve watercolor for the painting made during the film. The painting is interpreted by Chiaki Mihara as a portrait aesthetically expressive to the variations of nature, far from the static, linear, inert, and unchanging concept of space — running water, light change, and movement of vegetation. In Paraíso Tropical, Lucas Alves Costa proposes a reflection on art, the human presence in a natural environment, and the notion of perception to the spatial aesthetics.",
  "tropicalp3": "Produced during the film Paraíso Tropical, the painting Mata Atlântica (2017) is presented framed to the public in a gallery room.",
  "tropicalp4": "The painting Mata Atlântica was scanned in high resolution by Lucas Alves Costa, originating Mata Atlântica (Digital) (2017), projected in large scale on a gallery wall, presently isolated from the film and the physical painting. Even being connected by a direct link to Paraíso Tropical and Mata Atlântica, when visualized individually, the work achieves existential independence from the film and the physical painting. Presented in large scale, in a direct relationship with the space in which it is installed, the visual poetics of the painting Mata Atlântica is accentuated. The existence of Mata Atlântica becomes iconized.",
  "tropicalp5": "Lucas Alves Costa (1996, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "mundoAbertop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Mundo Aberto, Lucas Alves Costa's second solo exhibition with the gallery. A planet digitally constructed by the artist, with a large total area, is presented to the public through a virtual reality experience. The viewer is invited to a moment of complete immersion.",
  "mundoAbertop2": "The human brain's response to the perception and notion of an environment is primarily processed and issued from the light, color, and texture present in a space.",
  "mundoAbertop3": "In Mundo Aberto (VR, 2017–2018), it's proposed to perceive the difference in emotional reaction generated by the brain between knowing a virtual environment for the first time and knowing a real-world environment for the first time. Mundo Aberto, through virtual reality, deconstructs the need for physical dimensions to know a new environment, never visited before, proposing that similar emotional reactions can be obtained between the virtual and the real. Mundo Aberto proposes to the viewer an exercise to the notion of the possibility of autonomy in space and the immense spatial dimension of the constructed planet. Mundo Aberto expands the viewer's sensory understanding of the process of mutation and adaptation generated by the brain when there is a discovery of a new environment, never before visited.",
  "mundoAbertop4": "The virtual reality experience is simultaneously transmitted to the rest of the public present at the exhibition.",
  "mundoAbertop5": "In A superfície de Mundo Aberto (2018), a 3D printed of a cutout of the geography of the planet's surface introduced in virtual reality is presented over a plinth. The notion of scale and the similarity ratio between the 3D printed miniature and the planet introduced in virtual reality proposes to the public to construct a notion of magnitude, to contribute to the spatial understanding of the digitally constructed planet.",
  "mundoAbertop6": "Arranged on a gallery wall, in Visão Aérea de Mundo Aberto (2018) a screenshot taken by Lucas Alves Costa inside the Mundo Aberto virtual environment presents the surface portion materialized in the 3D print of A Superfície de Mundo Aberto.",
