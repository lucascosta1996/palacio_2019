  "sistemasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Partículas, Andrés Stephanou's third solo exhibition with the gallery. Originated from two new custom software conceived by the artist, two works are presented: Partículas (generative simulation, 2018–2019) — work with a homonymous title of the exhibition — and 1 minuto (2019).",
  "sistemasp2": "Composed in real-time, in the generative simulation Partículas, a concentrated mass of orchestrated particles performs in continuous motion in space, under unscheduled activity — in a constant rearrangement. With an operation managed by random algorithms and performed by a custom high-performance computer, Partículas is a simulation generated by a new custom software conceived by the artist. In its broader field of subjectivity, Partículas replicates the constant alterability and the infinite variability present in processes of nature.",
  "sistemasp3": "The custom software can produce more than two hundred thousand distinct versions of Partículas each hour operating in the exhibition. The visual composition generated by the software in the present will not recur in the future — an unreplicable visual composition is generated by the custom software at every instant of time.",
  "sistemasp4": "Contrasting with the complexity of construction present in the generative simulation Partículas, a blue line of light generated by a custom software is presented on one of the gallery's walls. 1 minuto (2019) executes a complete process of sixty seconds, continuously, in rotary motion. With an impalpable body to the public, 1 minuto proposes an experience of notion and perception to the equivalence and velocity of the passage of time.",
  "sistemasp5": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "particulasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Partículas de Luz, Andrés Stephanou's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Partículas de Luz presents two works composed by a new custom software conceived by the artist, introducing to the public two visualization versions of the visual matter generated by the software.",
  "particulasp2": "Partículas de Luz 1 (generative simulation, 2017–2018) and Partículas de Luz 2 (generative simulation, 2017–2018) are presented in real-time, operated by individual custom high-performance computers, in unconnected processes. While Partículas de Luz 1 introduces a close view of the visual matter generated by the software, Partículas de Luz 2 introduces a distant view.",
  "particulasp3": "Generative, the software simulates thousands of fluid moving light microparticles, constantly changing the concentration and the volume of the composition. With infinite duration and never repetitive visual configuration, the works presented reorganize in constant flux, producing unprogrammed and aleatory visual states, self-defined by random algorithms.",
  "particulasp4": "In Partículas de Luz, a unique exhibition is created at each instant of time. During the one-hour exhibition period, more than two hundred thousand distinct versions of Partículas de Luz 1 and Partículas de Luz 2 are self-generated, never occurring again each version. If arranged operating uninterruptedly for 24 hours, each of the works can generate over five million distinct visual compositions. The visual composition generated by the custom software in the present instant does not recur in the future.",
  "particulasp5": "Not presented by Andrés Stephanou in the exhibition,  Partículas de Luz (VR) (VR, generative simulation, 2017–2018) introduces a virtual reality visualization of the visual matter generated by the custom software — in an immersive and interactive experience.",
  "particulasp6": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "microp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Micropartículas, Andrés Stephanou's first solo exhibition with the gallery. Micropartículas is dedicated to the presentation of a single work, with a homonymous title of the exhibition.",
  "microp2": "Presenting aleatory visual estates, in Micropartículas (generative simulation, 2016–2017), thousands of particles interact and reorganize in a space. Under gravitational influence defined by random algorithms, the work produces a new irreplicable visual composition at each instant of time — Micropartículas is a work composed in real-time by a custom software conceived by the artist and operated by a custom high-performance computer.",
  "microp3": "More than three thousand distinct versions of Micropartículas are generated per minute in the exhibition. In an infinite activity, with ephemeral, cyclical and self-configuring moments, Micropartículas never repeat the visual composition generated, producing visual uniqueness at each instant of time — replicating the alterability and variability of processes and patterns seen in nature, in a subjective visual context. Unpredictable, uncontrollable, endless and non-replicable, Micropartículas produces visual matter in real-time.",
  "microp4": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "contatop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Contato Visual, Chiaki Mihara's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Two digital animations and one drawing are presented.",
  "contatop2": "Chiaki Mihara digitally developed two pairs of animated eyes in the presented works Contato Visual (1) (2018–2019) and Contato Visual (2) (2019), introduced projected into the exhibition space — in a confrontation with the public. With an incorporeal presence in the exhibition, the animated eyes move vividly under their emotional condition.",
  "contatop3": "Presenting constant changes of expression, the viewer is invited to confront Contato Visual (1) e Contato Visual (2), face to face, in an attempt to understand the present emotional state in the works. Proposing an exercise of symbiotic empathy, the works use the natural reaction of confrontation caused by the brain when an eye-to-eye contact is processed. With simple lines, the large, round, and brightly colored eyes are a direct influence of the Japanese descent of Chiaki Mihara and her relation with the anime culture.",
  "contatop4": "One of the drawings made by Chiaki Mihara as a study for the conception of the digital animations Contato Visual (1) and Contato Visual (2) is presented framed. In Estudo para Contato Visual (2018), several eyes, of multiple formats, under various emotional states, are figured disposing to the public understanding of the conception and construction of the exhibition.",
  "contatop5": "Chiaki Mihara (1997, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "autoretratosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A series of six concise drawings, produced with oil crayons on linen, are presented.",
  "autoretratosp2": "Descended from Japanese and influenced by anime culture, in Autorretratos, Chiaki Mihara proposes to the public an introspective confrontation with questions that refer to cultural and identity origins.",
  "autoretratosp3": "The succinct lines of the drawings presented in Autorretratos express to the public the natural essence of drawing of Chiaki Mihara, incorporated into the artist's identity. Transiting between the classic and the modern, the drawings contain a timeless language. Having drawing as its artistic foundation, in Autorretratos, an intimate sense is established to Chiaki Mihara's drawing aesthetics — introducing a synthesis of the artist's production.",
  "autoretratosp4": "Chiaki Mihara (1997, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "atividadep1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present A pesca enquanto atividade humana, Emerson da Silva's third solo exhibition with the gallery. A triptych film, an installation of photographs, and two photographs are presented.",
  "atividadep2": "A day of activity on a maritime fishing platform, located in a coastal region of the Atlantic Ocean, in southern Brazil, was recorded by Emerson da Silva in the triptych film Entre o Céu e o Oceano (three-channel HD video, 5.1, 10 min, 2019). Under an imagery language, the artist documented the complex equation for good fishing, structured in an interrelation of knowledge about the site-specific climatic and cultural factors. The film proposes relational particularities between human beings and nature — the human being and his socio-cultural relation with the space in which he lives.",
  "atividadep3": "Sixteen photographs of fish compose Espécies do Litoral Sul Brasileiro (2018-2019), an installation introduced as a catalog of species typical of the region documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano. Papa Terra, Sardinha, Baiacu Arara, Bagre, Maria Luiza, Xaréu, Peixe Espada, Savelha, Biterra, Peixe Rei, Linguado, Corvina, Branquinho, Pampo, Tainha e Bocuda — species of fish that inhabit the south coast of Brazil — are arranged composing the installation Espécies do Litoral Sul Brasileiro. During a month, in a proximity relation with local fishermen, Emerson da Silva followed the fishing activity on the sea platform recorded in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano, photographing and cataloging the fish caught by the fishermen.",
  "atividadep4": "In Pré-Consumo, Papa Terra (2019) and Pré-Consumo, Arraia (2019), two photographs are presented, portraying local fishermen of the maritime platform documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano during the process of cleaning a fish and a stingray for consumption. The photographs propose a symbolic reflection on fishing as a source of food and a historical identity of way of life.",
  "atividadep5": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "ventosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present O Regime dos Ventos, Emerson da Silva's second solo exhibition with the gallery. A film with a homonymous title of the exhibition, a composition of three photographs, and a photograph are presented.",
  "ventosp2": "In the film O Regime dos Ventos (HD video, stereo, 14 min, 2018), Emerson da Silva documented the wind as an agent in landscape formation in a coastal region in southern Brazil. On one side, the Atlantic Ocean. On the other side, coastal dunes. Amid this scenario, the buildings of the region's inhabitants are constantly buried, little by little, due to the sand carried by continuous wind actions. In an adaptation to the local weather conditions, a wind farm was built in the region. Three directly interconnected spheres are documented in the film: (1) coastal dunes formed by wind; (2) burial of buildings in areas of action of the natural course of the wind; (3) the adaptation of the human being to the climatic conditions of the space in which he lives through the construction of a wind farm.",
  "ventosp3": "Directly related to the film O Regime dos Ventos, three photographs are installed in a triptych composition. In Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento (2018), the photographs introduce a static condensation of the imagery and documentary narrative proposed in the film.",
  "ventosp4": "A photograph titled Parque Eólico Litorâneo (2018) presents the wind farm documented in the film O Regime dos Ventos portrayed at night.",
  "ventosp5": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "terrap1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Luz, Água e Terra Preta, Emerson da Silva's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A film, a photograph installation, and a photograph are presented.",
  "terrap2": "The life cycle of a group of lettuce in a small garden was documented during two months by Emerson da Silva in Terrestre (2017, HD video, stereo, 12 min). The lettuce and its evolutionary process are figured as a resonance of life on the planet Earth. Fertile to life, the earth's surface as a cultivation ground for food production — the planet Earth and its unique weather conditions. Terrestre is structured in four conjunctures:",
  "terrap3item1": "- The lettuce seeds fertilization in modules.",
  "terrap3item2": "- The transplantation of seedlings seeded, at the beginning of life, to the terrestrial soil.",
  "terrap3item3": "- The changing plasticity during the lettuce development life cycle.",
  "terrap3item4": "- The reach of adulthood of the group of lettuce grown and its final harvest.",
  "terrap4": "In Pré-Consumo, Alface Lisa (2017), a photograph is presented, introducing to the public a symbolic image to the narrative documented in the film Terrestre. The photograph perpetuates the existence of one of the lettuce from the small garden documented in the film, at the time of the pre-harvest life cycle; and subsequent consumption.",
  "terrap5": "An imagery narrative parallel to the one introduced in the film Terrestre is presented in an installation of seven photographs, with a homonymous title of the exhibition. In Luz, Água e Terra Preta (2017), the key elements employed by Emerson da Silva in the construction of the film Terrestre dialogue and interrelate. To the public is proposed an understanding of the narrative presented in the film from a new visual composition.",
  "terrap6": "Emerson da Silva (1988, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "lugarp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. The viewer is invited to participate in a new immersive experience in virtual reality.",
  "lugarp2": "When compared: the experience of being in a natural environment and the experience of being in a virtual environment, which replicates a natural environment — visualized through virtual reality. Is it possible for similar emotional results to be obtained?",
  "lugarp3": "With a homonymous title of the exhibition, in Um lugar para estar (VR, 2018–2019), is introduced to the viewer the notion of being present in a natural environment from an experience in virtual reality — deconstructing the need for physical dimensions to be in a natural environment. Um lugar para estar is presented in two POV viewing versions, for the free choice during the experience: daytime and nighttime. The virtual reality experience is simultaneously transmitted to the rest of the public present at the exhibition.",
  "lugarp4": "Being outdoors, seeing vegetation and the sky, feeling in touch with nature, are associated with high levels of emotional well-being. A close result is expected in an experience introduced in virtual reality, which visually replicates a natural environment. In Um lugar para estar, the viewer is invited to perform an insight exercise on the capacity of a virtual environment to play the same emotional role as a natural environment. The relation between human beings and the physical environment in which he finds himself as a direct influence to define his emotional state.",
  "lugarp5": "Terreno (2019), a work 3D printed, is presented on a plinth. The portion of geographic space utilized for the construction of the virtual environment introduced in Um lugar para estar is physically materialized in a miniature. From a small scale, perception and notion to the spatial dimension of the virtual environment are proposed to the public.",
  "lugarp6": "In Incidência de luz em um ambiente virtual (2019), two screenshots taken by Lucas Alves Costa in the virtual environment of Um lugar para estar are presented printed on Foam plates, introducing the two visualization versions proposed in the virtual experience: daytime and nighttime.",

  "tropicalp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Paraíso Tropical, Lucas Alves Costa's  first solo exhibition with the gallery. A film with a homonymous title of the exhibition and two works directly related to the film are presented.",
  "tropicalp2": "During the film Paraíso Tropical (4K video, stereo, 12 min, 2017), Lucas Alves Costa portrays Chiaki Mihara producing a painting in a scenario of abundant flora and fauna. Chiaki Mihara originated a rereading of the environment's atmosphere in a watercolor painting. In the middle of an Atlantic forest vegetation, there’s a passage of freshwater; the artist collected the same water to dissolve watercolor for the painting made during the film. The painting is interpreted by Chiaki Mihara as a portrait aesthetically expressive to the variations of nature, far from the static, linear, inert, and unchanging concept of space — running water, light change, and movement of vegetation. In Paraíso Tropical, Lucas Alves Costa proposes a reflection on art, the human presence in a natural environment, and the notion of perception to the spatial aesthetics.",
  "tropicalp3": "Produced by Chiaki Mihara during the film Paraíso Tropical, the painting Mata Atlântica (2017) is presented framed in a gallery room.",
  "tropicalp4": "The painting Mata Atlântica was scanned in high resolution by Lucas Alves Costa, originating Mata Atlântica (Digital) (2017). Projected on large scale on one of the gallery's walls, in a direct relationship with the space in which it is installed, the visual poetics of the painting Mata Atlântica is accentuated in Mata Atlântica (Digital).",

  "mundoAbertop2": "The human brain's response to the perception and notion of an environment is primarily processed from the light, color, and texture present in a space.",
  "mundoAbertop3": "Introduced in virtual reality, Mundo Aberto (VR, 2017–2018) proposes to the viewer an exercise to the possibility of free autonomy in space. The experience in virtual reality introduces a reflection on deterritorialization and multi-territoriality: the exclusion of borders, spatial divisions or lines of territorial division. In Mundo Aberto, a notion of the spontaneity of action is built in a virtual environment. The viewer is invited to a moment of complete immersion.",
  "mundoAbertop4": "The experience in virtual reality is simultaneously transmitted to the rest of the public present at the exhibition.",
  "mundoAbertop5": "In Superfície de Mundo Aberto (2018), a 3D printed of a cutout of the geography of the planet's surface introduced in virtual reality is presented over a plinth. The notion of scale and the similarity ratio between the 3D printed miniature and the planet introduced in Mundo Aberto proposes to the public construct a notion of magnitude.",
  "mundoAbertop6": "Portraying the surface portion materialized in the 3D print of Superfície de Mundo Aberto, a screenshot taken by Lucas Alves Costa inside Mundo Aberto virtual environment is presented framed in Visão Aérea de Mundo Aberto (2018).",
