  "sistemasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Flock of Particles Swarming, Andrés Stephanou's third solo exhibition with the gallery. Two new works are presented: Flock of Particles Swarming (2018–2019) and Line of Light (2019).",
  "sistemasp2": "Flock of Particles Swarming simulates a concentrated mass of particles performing in collective behavior. Constantly changing its shape, the concentrated mass of particles interacts under a never-ending and never repetitive process, capable of managing itself. A network of particles where each particle acts independently but following the same set of behavior rules. Such a set of behavior rules guide each particle on how to respond to the relationship with its nearest neighbors — interaction, alignment, cohesion, separation, and volume.",
  "sistemasp3": "Flock of Particles Swarming replicates the nonlinearity and decentralization seen in nature's self-organized pattern formation, in its broadest sense, from micro to macro scales; from cells to galaxies — the order emerging from the chaos. For Microparticles, Andrés Stephanou's first solo exhibition with the gallery, the artist wrote: “The manifestation of order from chaos is one of the key phenomena in nature's self-organization pattern formation. The main singularities in which the order emerges and is sustained have chaotic substrates as the synthesis of formation.” Resulting in a complex system, Flock of Particles Swarming explores the possibilities of meaning and perception, proposing new ways to interpret the world, nature, and life itself.",
  "sistemasp4": "Under a never-ending process, having no beginning, middle, and end, Flock of Particles Swarming introduces notion to temporality — past, present, and future. Flock of Particles Swarming presents the ability to generate infinite possibilities of self-organization. The current state of self-organization will not recur again. No two experiences of Flock of Particles Swarming are alike. The work proposes notions of continuity of motion, absence of permanence, and ephemerality.",
  "sistemasp5": "Line of Light presents a spinning line of light projected in a gallery's wall. Under a complete process of sixty seconds, Line of Light introduces notions of time, space, and matter, simultaneously.",
  "sistemasp6": "Andrés Stephanou (1993, Porto Alegre, Brazil) lives and works in Porto Alegre.",
  "particulasp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Light Particles, Andrés Stephanou's second solo exhibition with the gallery. The exhibition presents two new works, originated from a single software: Light Particles (Zoom In) (2017–2018) and Light Particles (Zoom Out) (2017–2018). Light Particles (Zoom In) introduces a close-up view of the visual matter generated by the software, while Light Particles (Zoom Out) introduces a far-off view. The works are operated by unconnected processes.",
  "particulasp2": "Generative, the software simulates tens of thousands of light particles in a fluid motion, constantly changing the alignment, cohesion, separation, and volume between the light particles, without any external influence. Thousands of self-propelled light particles perform independently but following the same set of behavior rules. Such a set of behavior rules guide each light particle on how to respond to the relationship with its nearest neighbors. A never-ending process that never repeats itself.",
  "particulasp3": "Light Particles (Zoom In) and Light Particles (Zoom Out) replicate the nonlinearity and decentralization present in nature's self-organized pattern formation, in its broadest sense — from cells to galaxies. The works are based on the notion that every self-organized pattern formation present in nature is a unique and non-replicable combination of factors. The current state of self-organization seen in each work will not recur again. Light Particles (Zoom In) and Light Particles (Zoom Out) explore notions of continuity of motion, absence of permanence, and ephemerality.",
  "particulasp4": "The exhibition Light Particles proposes to the viewer a free and personal interpretation of the visual matter generated by the works. Light Particles (Zoom In) and Light Particles (Zoom Out) explore the possibilities of meaning and perception, proposing new ways to interpret the world, nature, and life itself.",

  "microp2": "Microparticles (2016–2017) simulates a network of self-propelled microparticles performing under a never-ending process of interaction within a space. Unpredictable, change of behavior of the network spontaneously emerges out from the relations between each self-propelled microparticle.  The work proposes perception of its ability of rearrangement generated during the development of unscheduled events.",
  "microp3": "Microparticles replicates the nonlinearity and decentralization present in nature's self-organized pattern formation, in its broadest sense — the order emerging from the chaos. For Microparticles, Andrés Stephanou wrote: “The manifestation of order from the chaos is one of the key phenomena in nature's self-organization pattern formation. The main singularities in which the order emerges and is sustained have chaotic substrates as the synthesis of formation.” For its conception, the work was based on the notion that every self-organized pattern formation found in nature is a unique and non-replicable combination of factors.",
  "microp4": "Microparticles manifests visual singularity at each instant of time. The current self-organization state will not recur in the future. If arranged operating uninterruptedly for 24 hours, Microparticles can generate over five million distinct self-organization states of itself, never repetitive. No two experiences of Microparticles are alike.",

  "contatop1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Contato Visual, Chiaki Mihara's second solo exhibition with the gallery. Two digital animations and one drawing are presented: Contato Visual (Azul) (2018–2019), Contato Visual (Vermelho) (2019), and Estudo para Contato Visual (2018).",
  "contatop2": "The digital animations Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) consists of two pairs of animated eyes moving vividly under their emotional condition, constantly changing its expression. Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho) are presented projected on the gallery's walls. Introducing an exercise of symbiotic empathy to the viewer, the digital animations communicate with the natural reaction of confrontation generated by the brain when an eye-to-eye contact is processed.",
  "contatop3": "The viewer is invited to confront Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho), face-to-face, in an attempt to understand the emotional state of digital animations. With simple lines, the large, round, and brightly colored eyes are an influence of the Japanese descent of Chiaki Mihara, and her relation with anime. In Contato Visual, the artist intrinsically proposes a dialogue around identity and cultural issues.",
  "contatop4": "Estudo para Contato Visual introduces one of the drawings made by Chiaki Mihara as a study for the construction of the digital animations Contato Visual (Azul) and Contato Visual (Vermelho). Several eyes, of multiple formats, under various emotional states, are figured disposing to the public understanding of the process of conception of the digital animations.",

  "atividadep1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present A pesca enquanto atividade humana, Emerson da Silva's third solo exhibition with the gallery. A triptych film, an installation of photographs, and two photographs are presented.",
  "atividadep2": "The triptych film Entre o Céu e o Oceano (2019) records a day of activity on a fishing platform located in a coastal region of the Atlantic Ocean, in southern Brazil. Emerson da Silva documented the complex equation for good fishing, structured on the interrelationship of knowledge about local climatic, biological, and cultural factors. The film builds a narrative around the spatial, cultural, and social relationships of human beings with the ocean. For Entre o Céu e o Oceano, Emerson da Silva wrote: “The culture of a local, as a heritage of its population, is carved as a way of life of a social group according to the idealized vision of being and seeing the world in which they are inserted. Such a way of life is defined from subjective and objective practices, introducing forms of social particularities.”",
  "atividadep3": "Espécies do Litoral Sul Brasileiro (2019) presents an installation of photographs. The installation was constructed as a catalog of fish species typical of the region documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano. During a month, in a close relationship with local fishermen, Emerson da Silva followed the activity on the fishing platform recorded in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano, photographing and cataloging the fish caught by the fishermen.",
  "atividadep4": "In Papa Terra (2019) and Arraia (2019), two individual photographs are presented. The photographs portray local fishermen of the fishing platform documented in the film Entre o Céu e o Oceano during the process of cleaning a fish and a stingray for consumption. Papa Terra and Arraia figure a socio-cultural representation of fishing as a historical identity of a way of life.",

  "ventosp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present O Regime dos Ventos, Emerson da Silva's second solo exhibition with the gallery. A film with the same title of the exhibition, three photographs, and a photograph are presented.",
  "ventosp2": "The film O Regime dos Ventos (2018) documents and synthesizes the wind as an agent in the landscape formation in a coastal region in southern Brazil. On one side, dunes; on the other side, the Atlantic Ocean. Amid this scenario, the buildings of the region's inhabitants are constantly buried, little by little, due to the sand carried by continuous wind actions. In an adaptation to the local weather conditions, a wind farm was built in the region.",
  "ventosp3": "O Regime dos Ventos presents a systemic approach that symbolizes, circularly and relationally, the spatial reality of a coastal region in southern Brazil. Are explored the multiple landscape transformations of different scenarios and the consequences that the relationship between human beings and nature produced in the region's spatiality. The film is structured in three pillars: coastal dunes formed by the wind; burial of buildings in areas of action of the natural course of the wind; the spatial adaptation of human beings through the construction of a wind farm.",
  "ventosp4": "Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento (2018) presents three photographs arranged as a triptych. Dunas, Torre Eólica, Soterramento synthesizes the narrative proposed in the film from photographs that portray the three central subjects of O Regime dos Ventos.",
  "ventosp5": "A photograph titled Parque Eólico Litorâneo (2018) presents the wind farm documented in the film O Regime dos Ventos portrayed at night.",

  "terrap1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Luz, Água e Terra Preta, Emerson da Silva's first solo exhibition with the gallery. A film, an installation of photographs, and a photograph are presented.",
  "terrap2": "The film Terrestre (2017) records the life cycle of a group of lettuce in a small garden, from fertilization to pre-harvest. As a central subject of the film, the development of a lettuce garden is documented from the construction of a context formed by elements of social order (the relationship of human beings with the environment in which he lives); of spatial order (the construction of a narrative around a portion of space); of cultural order (the individualized relationship of each human being with the environment that inhabits); and of systemic order (the network of processes established in relationships between human beings and nature).",
  "terrap3": "The narrative presented in the film Terrestre is structured in four spheres: the lettuce seeds fertilization in modules; the transplantation of seedlings seeded, at the beginning of life, to the terrestrial soil; the plasticity of the lettuce development cycle; and the reach of adulthood of the group of lettuce grown and its final harvest.",
  "terrap4": "The photograph Alface Lisa (2017) portrays a lettuce seedling from the small garden documented in the film Terrestre, at the time of the pre-harvest life cycle — and subsequent consumption.",
  "terrap5": "With the same title of the exhibition, Luz, Água e Terra Preta (2017) introduces a narrative analogous to the film Terrestre from an installation of photographs. The key factors employed in the construction of the film dialogue and relate in Luz, Água e Terra Preta.",

  "lugarp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Um lugar para estar, Lucas Alves Costa's third solo exhibition with the gallery. A virtual reality experience with the same title of the exhibition, a 3D printed sculpture, and a diptych of digital prints are presented.",
  "lugarp2": "Um lugar para estar (2018–2019) introduces the notion of being present in a natural environment from an experience in virtual reality, deconstructing the need for physical dimensions. Um lugar para estar is presented in two first-person view versions, for the free choice during the experience: daytime and nighttime. As a starting point for the construction of the virtual reality experience, Lucas Alves Costa wrote: “When compared: the experience of being in a natural environment and the experience of being in a virtual environment, which replicates a natural environment — visualized through virtual reality. Is it possible for similar emotional results to be obtained?”",
  "lugarp3": "Being outdoors, seeing vegetation and the sky, feeling in touch with nature, are associated with high levels of emotional well-being. A close result is expected in an experience introduced in virtual reality, which visually replicates a natural environment. In Um lugar para estar, the viewer is invited to perform a self-reflection exercise on the capacity of a virtual environment to play the same emotional role as a natural environment. The relation between human beings and the physical environment in which he finds himself as a direct influence to define his emotional state.",
  "lugarp4": "Terreno (2019), a 3D printed sculpture, is presented on a plinth. The portion of geographic space utilized for the construction of the virtual environment introduced in Um lugar para estar was physically materialized in a miniature. From a small scale, Terreno proposes to the viewer perception and notion to the spatial dimension of the virtual environment of Um lugar para estar. Terreno embodies the possibility of digitally carve a geographical space with unique characteristics.",
  "lugarp5": "Incidência de luz em um ambiente virtual (2019) presents a diptych of two digital prints. Printed on Foam, both two digital prints introduce the same portrait of the virtual environment of Um lugar para estar, differentiated by the incidence of simulated light on the virtual environment: daytime and nighttime.",

  "tropicalp1": "Galeria Palácio is pleased to present Paraíso, the first solo exhibition by Lucas Alves Costa with the gallery. A film with the same title of the exhibition and two works directly related to the film are presented.",
  "tropicalp2": "The film Paraíso (2017) records the artist Chiaki Mihara producing a painting in a scenario of Atlantic Forest, in the south of Brazil, with abundant flora and fauna. Chiaki Mihara originated a rereading of the environment's atmosphere in a watercolor painting during the film. Paraíso proposes a narrative between human presence in an environment of abundant nature and his perception of the present spatial aesthetics. Implicitly, Lucas Alves Costa introduces a personal point of view to a spatial identity representation of Brazil, in its essence, from a synthesis place. For the film Paraíso, Lucas Alves Costa wrote: “Synthesize the intrinsic chain of relationships established between human beings and space, exploring the role of each variable present in the spatial scenario and broadening the notion of complexity of this chain.”",
  "tropicalp3": "Produced by Chiaki Mihara during the film Paraíso, the painting Mata Atlântica (2017) is presented in the exhibition. The painting is interpreted by Chiaki Mihara as a portrait aesthetically expressive to the variations of nature, far from the static, linear, inert, and unchanging concept of space — running water, light change, and movement of vegetation.",
  "tropicalp4": "The painting Mata Atlântica was scanned in high resolution, originating Mata Atlântica (Digital) (2017). Projected on a large scale on one of the gallery's walls, in a direct relationship with the space in which it is installed, the aesthetic of the painting Mata Atlântica is enlarged in Mata Atlântica (Digital).",

  "mundoAbertop2": "As a central subject  of his practice, Lucas Alves Costa explores the notion of spatiality and presence in space. “Understanding the influence of spatial circumstances on social relationships enables the characterization of subjacent factors that directly contribute to the personal construction of each individual.”",
  "mundoAbertop3": "Mundo Aberto (2017–2018) presents a digitally built planet, with a large total area, introduced in virtual reality. In an experience of free autonomy in space, Mundo Aberto investigates the spontaneity of action in an environment of virtual dimensions from a moment of complete immersion. The virtual reality experience proposes to the viewer  construct a notion of magnitude. For Mundo Aberto, Lucas Alves Costa wrote: “The human brain's response to the perception and notion of an environment is primarily processed from the light, color, and texture present in a space.”",

  "andresA": "Andrés Stephanou's work replicates the constant alterability and the infinite variability present in nature's pattern-forming processes, in the broader field of subjectivity. At the center of his research, the artist is based on the notion that every pattern present in nature is a unique equation, composed of a complex interrelated chain of processes that connect to the environment. Conceiving generative software, Andrés Stephanou explores the ability of a digitally constructed system achieves an organized pattern of existence by itself, without any external force acting. Digital systems self-managed by self-sustaining and self-executing processes. In Microparticles (2017), Andrés Stephanou's first solo exhibition with the gallery, the artist wrote: 'The manifestation of order from chaos is one of the key phenomena in nature's patterning processes. The main singularities in which the order emerges and is sustained have chaotic substrates as the synthesis of formation.'.",

  "chiakiA": "Chiaki Mihara's practice encompasses drawings, paintings, and digital animations, navigating on analog and digital media. Having drawing as its artistic foundation and conceiving digital animations, the artist pays tribute to a vast array of historical and contemporary art practices, introducing a dialogue between the traditional and the modern. Her work explores the perception, notion, and interpretation of gesture and emotion. In her drawings, paintings, and digital animations, the confrontation serves as a field for the artist’s construction of narratives. Due to her Japanese descent, Chiaki Mihara has the contemporary culture of Japan, especially the anime, as a direct influence on her works, both conceptually and aesthetically. As a result, the artist intrinsically introduces cultural and identity issues.",

  "emersonA": "Emerson da Silva Silva works with films, photography, and installations. Through objective and subjective topics, his work introduces narratives of the interrelationship between nature and the human being from  social, cultural, and spatial factors— and the particularities resulting from this equation. From compositions of images, Emerson da Silva explores the viewer's perception and understanding of the meaning dialogue of a concept proposed from images arranged together. The socio-cultural relationship of exploration and extraction between the human being and the environment in which he inhabits is investigated by Emerson da Silva, as written by the artist for his latest film Entre o Céu e o Oceano (2019): 'The culture of a local, as a heritage of its population, is inscribed as a way of life of a social group according to the idealized vision of being and seeing the world in which they are inserted. Such a way of life is defined from subjective and objective practices, introducing forms of social particularities.'.",

  "lucasA": "Lucas Alves Costa's interdisciplinary practice ranges from virtual reality and 3D printed sculptures, to films. The artist concentrates his research around the concept that the notion of space and place occupies a central position in the understanding of human being's relations with the social environment in which he is present. In his virtual reality experiences, 3D printed sculptures, and films, Lucas Alves Costa investigates the notion of spatiality and presence in space. The artist explores the effects of environmental conditions on individual emotions as well as how the individual perceives and interprets it. Lucas Alves Costa construct narratives based on the implicit chain of relationships established between human beings and space and place, exploring the role of each variable present in the scenario and broadening the notion of complexity of this chain. The artist synthesizes his research: 'Understanding the influence of spatial circumstances on social relations enables the characterization of subjacent factors that directly contribute to the personal construction of each individual.'.",
